# ANALYSIS OF BELLABEAT PRODUCTS

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products. Their mission is to become a major player in the  production of smart devices.
They desire to find new opportunities to grow their business. For that reason, we will analyze information about its current users utilizing the products offered by the company (smart devices). The mission is to find trends in the data and make useful recommendations for the company.
I will try to answer these questions:

 * What are some trends in smart device usage?
 * How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
 * How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy
## PREPARE
This data set contains a personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users.  It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore habits and patterns.

### LIMITATIONS

Data was collected in the year 2016. Users' daily activities, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant. A sample size of 33 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population and weight data is only from 8 users. As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.



# Recommendation 

* Calories are burnt by the steps taken daily. Based on users’ objectives, Bellabeat could recommend a minimum number of steps for users to take to encourage them to achieve their goals.

* To create a habit of exercising every day, Bellabeat could send a notification at a specific time for the user to remain consistent throughout the week.

* The data shows that to sleep better the best type of exercise is light to moderate (less than 10,000 steps). Bellabeat could recommend this level of exercise for people who want to simply maintain a healthy lifestyle, i.e. don’t perform high-level sports.

* Studies have shown that a routine before bed can help achieve a night of better sleep. Bellabeat could send a reminder to start that routine at a certain time and recommend activities to relax and improve sleep.

* Bellabeat could also recommend some health and fitness articles within the Bellabeat app as a great way to motivate users.
